**Healthier Comparison McDonald's vs Starbucks**

**Introduction**
McDonald's and Starbucks are two of the most popular fast-food chains in the world. While both chains offer a variety of menu items, they differ significantly in terms of nutritional content. In this project, we will compare the nutritional content of menu items from McDonald's and Starbucks.

**Methodology**
We will use data from the McDonald's and Starbucks websites to compare the nutritional content of menu items. We will focus on the following nutrients: calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, and sodium.

**Results**
Here are the results of our comparison:

* **Breakfast Items**
	+ McDonald's: Egg McMuffin (300 calories, 13g fat, 31g carbs, 17g protein, 750mg sodium)
	+ Starbucks: Chonga Bagel (300 calories, 5g fat, 50g carbs, 12g protein, 10mg sodium)
* **Beverages**
	+ McDonald's: Iced Coffee (0 calories, 0g fat, 0g carbs, 0g protein, 0mg sodium)
	+ Starbucks: Iced Coffee (0 calories, 0g fat, 0g carbs, 0g protein, 0mg sodium)
* **Lunch Items**
	+ McDonald's: Big Mac (530 calories, 27g fat, 47g carbs, 24g protein, 960mg sodium)
	+ Starbucks: Chicken BLT Salad Sandwich (470 calories, 25g fat, 35g carbs, 21g protein, 35mg sodium)
* **Desserts**
	+ McDonald's: Apple Pie (250 calories, 13g fat, 32g carbs, 2g protein, 170mg sodium)
	+ Starbucks: Chocolate Cake Pop (160 calories, 8g fat, 23g carbs, 2g protein, 10mg sodium)

**Conclusion**
Our comparison shows that Starbucks menu items tend to have fewer calories and less fat than McDonald's menu items. However, some Starbucks menu items have more sugar and sodium than their McDonald's counterparts. It's essential to consider the nutritional content of menu items when making choices at either chain.

**Recommendations**
If you're looking for a healthier option, consider choosing a Starbucks menu item. However, be mindful of the sugar and sodium content of some Starbucks menu items. If you prefer McDonald's, consider choosing a smaller portion size or a menu item with fewer calories and less fat.

**Future Work**
In the future, we can expand our comparison to include more menu items and nutrients. We can also explore the impact of ingredients and preparation methods on the nutritional content of menu items.
