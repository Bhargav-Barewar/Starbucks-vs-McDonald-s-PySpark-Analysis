**Healthier Comparison McDonald's vs Starbucks**

**Introduction**
McDonald's and Starbucks are two of the most popular fast-food chains in the world. While both chains offer a variety of menu items, they differ significantly in terms of nutritional content. In this project, we will compare the nutritional content of menu items from McDonald's and Starbucks.

**Methodology**
We will use data from the McDonald's and Starbucks websites to compare the nutritional content of menu items. We will focus on the following nutrients: calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, and sodium.

## 🍽 Nutritional Comparison

The data collected from the menus of both brands allow us to calculate the average nutritional content per item.

| **Nutrient** | **McDonald's<br>(Avg per item)** | **Starbucks<br>(Avg per item)** | **Healthier Option** | **Why**           |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Calories     | 368.27 kcal                  | 257.24 kcal                   | Starbucks             | Lower Calories    |
| Total Fat    | 14.17 g                      | 10.06 g                       | Starbucks             | Lower Fat         |
| Sugars       | 29.42 g                      | -                             | -                     | -                 |
| Carbs        | 47.35 g                      | 33.97 g                       | Starbucks             | Lower Carbs       |
| Protein      | 13.34 g                      | 8.19 g                        | McDonald's            | Higher Protein    |


**Conclusion**
Our comparison shows that Starbucks menu items tend to have fewer calories and less fat than McDonald's menu items. However, some Starbucks menu items have more sugar and sodium than their McDonald's counterparts. It's essential to consider the nutritional content of menu items when making choices at either chain.

**Recommendations**
If you're looking for a healthier option, consider choosing a Starbucks menu item. However, be mindful of the sugar and sodium content of some Starbucks menu items. If you prefer McDonald's, consider choosing a smaller portion size or a menu item with fewer calories and less fat.

**Future Work**
In the future, we can expand our comparison to include more menu items and nutrients. We can also explore the impact of ingredients and preparation methods on the nutritional content of menu items.
